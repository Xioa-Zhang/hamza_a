1.3.  Effects of  the Industri...","While the Industrial Revolution didn't originate in Sri Lanka, its effects were felt significantly because Sri Lanka was a British colony at the time.  The British established large-scale plantations (tea, coconut, rubber), importing machinery from Britain to process these crops.  This led to the creation of factories and a demand for labor, forming a new working class.  A wealthy, educated middle class also emerged among landowners and factory owners.  The development of infrastructure, including roads (using the Macadam method) and a railway system (starting with the Colombo to Kandy line), facilitated trade and the growth of cities beyond Colombo.  A formal postal system and telegraph service were also introduced.  In short, the Industrial Revolution spurred economic and infrastructural changes in Sri Lanka, though it was driven by British colonial interests.",N/A,"27, 28, 9"

This system lasted from 1798 to 1802, with a governor responsible to the British crown and the East India Company still in charge of collecting revenue.  The system failed because the East India Company officers did not adequately support the governor, leading to its discontinuation in 1802.  The text does not offer further reasons for the lack of support.",N/A,"36, 61, 75"

They took place in Baddegama (1865), Waragoda (1865), Udanwita (1866), Gampola (1871), and Panadura (1873).  They are significant because they demonstrate how Buddhist monks used public debate to defend their religion against missionary efforts and contributed to the Buddhist renaissance by bolstering Buddhist confidence and public support.",N/A,"51, 54, 56"

Leaders like Anagarika Dharmapala, Walisinghe Harischandra, Piyadasa Sirisena, and John De Silva used various media to instill patriotism.  The establishment of Buddhist schools and pirivens cultivated a generation that valued Sri Lankan culture.  Furthermore, movements to protect Buddhist religious sites and a push for a non-alcoholic lifestyle were also part of this broader nationalist effort.",N/A,"51, 56, 57"

In parallel to the changes that took place ...","In the early 20th century, the Sri Lankan middle class, unhappy with the lack of political change despite economic and social transformations,  demanded constitutional reform.

These reforms and the growth of plantations created new job opportunities and avenues for investment, leading to the rise of a wealthy, educated class distinct from the traditional aristocracy.  Specific examples include jobs as contractors supplying plantations, involvement in arrack production and distribution, graphite mining, wholesale and retail sales, transportation, and coconut cultivation.  The new middle class also benefited from new professional opportunities such as lawyers, engineers, surveyors, clerks, and civil servants.",N/A,"27, 75, 85, 86"
