Mining coal was difficult, leading to inventions to address problems like water removal from deep mines, poisonous gases, heat, and lighting.

Humphry Davy's safety lamp (1812) solved the lighting problem, and in 1839, iron cables replaced the old method of coal extraction using women and children and copper cables.

The British established large-scale plantations (tea, coconut, rubber) and factories, importing machinery from Britain.  This led to the creation of a labor class working for wages, and a wealthy class of landowners and factory owners emerged.  The development of infrastructure, including roads and a railway system (starting with the Colombo to Kandy line in 1867), facilitated trade and the growth of cities.  A postal system and telegraph service were also introduced.  The Colebrooke reforms contributed to the development of a capitalist economic system, creating new opportunities in areas like contracting, arrack production, and graphite mining.  However, the British primarily used Sri Lanka as a market for their own products, hindering the development of Sri Lanka's own industrial sector.","when industrial revolution started.
